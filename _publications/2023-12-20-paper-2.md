The therapeutic promise of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) has long drawn researchersâ€™ interest, but their clinical application is complicated by intercellular heterogeneity. Single-cell RNA sequencing enables the characterization of this heterogeneity. In this study, we integrated data from 17 studies, profiling a total of 494,997 cells. We identified 18 MSC subsets along with their gene markers.
