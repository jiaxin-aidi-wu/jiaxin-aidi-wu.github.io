## 1. Data source and information
### 1.1 Paper link: 
[https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0242171]

### 1.2 Methods:
barcode sequences were extracted from the read 1 fastq files. The read 2 fastq files, which included each cell mRNA, were directly aligned to Refseq transcript sequences.

### 1.3 Samples:
 Male mice of the C57BL/6NCr strain at 6 and 29 months of age were obtained from the animal facility of TMIG. 

 ## 2. Process

 ## 3. Paper conclusion
 ASC markers : Gsn, Cxcl1, Col1a2, Col6a1, Mmp2, Mmp14 
 Age-related changes and pseudotime progression were observed in the genes *Adamts7, Egfr, and Igfbp4*; however, the genes *Snai2, Tgfbr1, Lpl, and Efemp1* did not show significant differences with aging.
